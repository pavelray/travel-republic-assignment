# travel-republic-assignment
This the coding assignment given by the travel republic. I tried to follow the SOLID principal to structure the problem.

Write a console application to invoke the GetFlights method and return the flights from the FlightBuilder class based on the following filters: 
 
1. Depart before the current date/time.
2. Have a segment with an arrival date before the departure date.
3. Spend more than 2 hours on the ground. i.e those with a total gap of over two hours between the arrival date of one segment and the departure date of the next.
 
While solving the problem correctly is important this is an opportunity to show how you would go about structuring a solution to the problem. Include as much or as little as you deem appropriate. 
As a starting point it is highly likely we will want to adjust, add to or remove from these rules. Please make sure your solution can adapt to changes of similar nature.
